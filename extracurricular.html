        <p>  <span id="space"></span> Some extracurricular activites I do are drums and chess. In drums, I learned how to play
        "We Will Rock You" and "Butter". The band who played "We will Rock You" is Queens
        and the band who created "Butter" is BTS. I learn drums at Musicians Woodshed and if you
        are interested in learning how to play an instrument like drums, sign up to do lessons there
        (The first lesson is free). <br>  <span id="space"></span> Another activity I like to do and probably you like is chess! I am a decent chess player and 
        if you want to play chess, play on lichess or chess kids. Another opition is to play in 
        chess tournaments to upgrade your rating and you will facing people that are good. That 
        Is some the extracurricular activites I do.
