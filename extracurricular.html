        Some extracurricular activites I do are drums,drawing, and chess. In drums, I learned how to play
        "We Will Rock You", "My Universe", and "Boy with Luv". The band who played "We will Rock You" is Queens
        and the band who created "My Universe" and "Boy with Luv" is bts here is a video of me playin those three 
        songs.
