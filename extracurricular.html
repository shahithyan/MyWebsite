        <p>Some extracurricular activites I do are drums, drawing, and chess. In drums, I learned how to play
        "We Will Rock You" and "Butter". The band who played "We will Rock You" is Queens
        and the band who created "Butter" is BTS. Here is a video of me playing those two 
        songs.
